# Java_Image_Forgery_Detector
Active image forgery detector which is implemented using Java
Digital images forgery detection is still an active research in image 
analysis projects. A reliable approach for RGB digital image forgery 
detection is implemented in this project. Our method is based on the 
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the original image in which the 
features of the image is extracted and then pushed into cellular automata 
to generate the Robust Secret Key for the image authentication. 
SVD is used as a strong mathematical tool to decompose the RGB Digital 
Image into three orthogonal matrices and create features that are 
rotation invariant. Source code (Java) is available here.
